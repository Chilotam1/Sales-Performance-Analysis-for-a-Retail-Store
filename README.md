### 1.  Project Overview
---
This project presents the results of LITA store sales analysis aimed at addressing the issue of low turnover of some products and regional areas. The analysis aims to generate insight into the sales performance of LITA store, by analyzing various parameters in the data received. I seek to gather enough insight to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the store's performance.

### 2. Data Sources
---
The primary source of data used here is Sales_Data.csv. This dataset was given to me by Incubator Hub and similar dataset can also be gotten from any open data source online.

### 3. Tools
---
- Ms Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   - Data Cleaning
   - Pivot Table Analysis
- SQL - Quering and Analysis
- PowerBi - Data Visualization
- GitHub -  Portfolio building

### 4. Analysis Workflow
---
#### 4.1 Data Preparation in Excel
- Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates
- Basic Calculations:
   1. Using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
   2. Using Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product, total revenue by region, and total revenue by product.
   3. Creating a column for the total revenue by multiplying Quantity and Unit Price

#### 4.2 SQL Queries and Data Analysis
- Data Import: Importing the cleaned Excel data into SQL Server.
- Data Transformation: Using SQL queries to filter, group, and aggregate data.

#### 4.3 PowerBi Dashboard Development
- Data Import: Importing the raw data into PowerBi
- Data Transformation: Removing duplicates and blank rows, as well as creating measures
- Visualizations: Creating visuals such as column charts, bar charts, donut chart, and cards represent sales data.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the total sales for each product category?
- What is the total revenue per product?
- What are the the top-performing products?
- What is the percentage of total sales contributed by each region?

### 6. Data Analysis
---
This includes some queries I worked with during the analysis. Example:

``` sql
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenue
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC;
```

``` sql
SELECT 
    Region,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Total_Revenue IS NOT NULL THEN Total_Revenue ELSE 0 END) AS Region_Sales,
   (SUM(CASE WHEN Total_Revenue IS NOT NULL THEN Total_Revenue ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / 
   (SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN Total_Revenue IS NOT NULL THEN Total_Revenue ELSE 0 END) FROM SalesData) AS Total_Sales_Percentage
FROM 
    SalesData
GROUP BY 
    Region;
```

### 8. Results/Findings
At the end of this data analysis , it was determined that;
  1.  The product with the highest total sales value is Shoes with a total sale of 613,380.
  2.  The highest-selling product by total quantity sold is Hat with a total of 15,929.
  3.  East had the highest number of sold products.
  4.  Higher percentage of the total revenue was generated from sales in the South.
  5.  In the current year, February had the highest sales with 298,800 sales.
  6.  The total revenue per product is;

      |PRODUCT|REVENUE|
      |-------|-------|
      |Shoes|613,380|
      |Shirt|485,600|
      |Hat|316,195|
      |Gloves|296,900|
      |Jacket|208,230|
      |Socks|180,785|

### 9. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions;
   - Allocate budget toward promoting Gloves, Jackets, and Socks to expand their market share. Running campaigns and discounts during colder months may be effective, as these products align with winter needs and may drive higher purchase volumes.
   - With February identified as the highest sales month, itâ€™s recommended to prepare ahead for similar seasonal demand in upcoming years. Increase inventory levels, especially for top products like Shoes and Shirts, and plan promotional events or discounts in early June to capture customer interest.
   - The East region shows the highest number of sold products, indicating a strong customer base. Allocate additional resources, such as targeted promotions and localized advertising, to further boost engagement in this high-performing region.
   - Since Shoes are the top-selling product by sales, consider prioritizing this product in marketing campaigns and feature it prominently in both online and in-store displays. 
     
### 10. Limitations and Learnings
I had to remove duplicate entries that would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion in the analysis. Through this analysis, I was able to gain more insights in handling data inconsistencies, SQL query optimization, and Power BI performance.
